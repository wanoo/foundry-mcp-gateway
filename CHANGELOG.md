# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here.
The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

**Response shapes** — the contract documented in
[docs/integrators.md](docs/integrators.md) — only change on a **major** version.

## [1.5.0] — 2026-07-19

*First release aimed at people other than its author.*

### Added

- **`--dump-tools`, `--version`, `--help`** — the full tool catalogue as JSON
  without connecting to Foundry. It also became the source of truth for
  `scripts/check-docs.sh`, which fails CI when the READMEs' numbers drift from
  the code. They had drifted three times; the READMEs once announced 131 *and*
  134 tools on the same page.
- **Version drift detection** — the gateway and the companion module now share
  one version number, and `client_status` reports `versionDrift` naming the half
  that's behind, instead of leaving you to compare by eye.
- **Automated publishing** — bump the version, push, and the workflow tags,
  builds a multi-arch Docker image, cuts the release with binaries, and
  publishes to crates.io. Nothing else to run.
- **Collaboration kit** — Contributor Covenant 3.0, a security policy stating
  the real threat model, issue forms, PR template, dependabot, CODEOWNERS.

### Fixed

- **The quick start's first step was impossible.** It told readers to find the
  bot's `_id` in `view-source:/join`; in Foundry v13 that page is a 2 KB
  client-rendered shell, verified on both a live world and a fresh container.
  Rewritten around a browser-console one-liner.
- Tool counts now stated honestly: 134 with `FOUNDRY_ADMIN_PASSWORD`, 126
  without, 50 read-only — the number depends on configuration, which the docs
  used to hide.

## [1.4.0] — 2026-07-19

*Cross-server migration validated end to end against a real second server
(Foundry 13.351 in Docker): system installed, world created and launched,
player accounts recreated, 48 folders + 112 journals + 20 actors + 12 scenes +
2 tables + 25 macros copied, assets uploaded across servers, `_id`s preserved.*

### Added

- **Plain-HTTP and custom-port instances** — a `hostname` may now carry an
  explicit scheme (`http://foundry.lan:30000`), and localhost targets default to
  HTTP. Local/dev Foundry containers were previously unreachable: every URL was
  hardcoded to `https://`/`wss://`.

### Fixed

- **`copy_documents` rejected `journals`** — its own description advertised the
  plural, but the code only accepted the internal `journal`. Both work now, as
  everywhere else.
- **`admin_create_world` and `admin_install_package`** are no longer untested:
  both drove the migration above.

## [1.3.0] — 2026-07-19

### Added

- **`admin_create_world`** and **`admin_install_package`** — the last two links
  of a cross-server migration: stand up an empty world on the target and bring
  it to module/system parity before pouring content in. Together with
  `copy_documents`, `copy_assets` and `manage_users`, a world can be recreated
  on a fresh server end to end. ⚠️ Both are implemented from the setup protocol
  but **not yet exercised against a live server** — creating worlds and
  installing packages on someone's instance isn't something to test unprompted.

## [1.2.0] — 2026-07-19

### Added

- **Multi-world**: several instances are now served **simultaneously**, one
  socket each, opened on demand. Every tool accepts an `instance` argument;
  `choose_foundry_instance` only moves the default and no longer tears the
  connection down. Validated live with two concurrent connections under two
  different accounts.
- **`copy_assets`** — carry the files (maps, tokens, art, audio) along with the
  documents: walks the source storage, recreates the tree on the target and
  uploads what's missing, streaming through the gateway so the two servers never
  need to reach each other. This is what makes a **cross-server** clone actually
  work, since document image paths alone would dangle.
- **`copy_documents`** — move content between instances: `where`/`ids` selection,
  `_id`s preserved so `@UUID` links survive, folders recreated, `dry_run`,
  and `overwrite` that **updates** the target's existing twin instead of
  duplicating it.

## [1.0.0] — 2026-07-18

*130 tools · 50 of them read-only · validated against a live Foundry v13.351 world.*

First stable release. The server is feature-complete for its scope, in
production, and its response shapes are now a versioned contract.

### Added

- **Read-only mode** — `FOUNDRY_READONLY=1` exposes only the 50 read-only tools
  and refuses writes at dispatch (defence in depth). Lets you plug untrusted or
  player-facing integrations into the same world.
- **User management** — `manage_users`: list accounts, create/update/delete
  them, set roles (player / trusted / assistant / gamemaster), assign
  characters. Passwords are deliberately **not** handled: the GM sets them in
  Foundry; accounts are created password-less.
- **Backups** — `admin_list_backups`, `admin_backup_world`, and an automatic
  backup before `admin_update_package` (disable with `backup: false`; a failed
  backup aborts the update). Validated live: a 150 MB world archived in seconds.
- **Generic dice** — `client_roll_formula`: any formula through Foundry's real
  `Roll` engine, on any system, with the native chat card, Dice So Nice, actor
  roll data, GM whisper, and per-die results.
- **MCP 2025-06-18** — protocol version negotiation (2025-03-26 clients still
  get 2025-03-26) and `structuredContent` on every object-shaped result.
- **Docker** — multi-stage `Dockerfile` (119 MB image, `/health` healthcheck).
- **Integrator docs** — `docs/integrators.md`: exact response shapes.

### Changed

- `admin_check_package` now works **while the world is running** (it reads the
  remote manifest at its declared URL).
- `admin_update_package` retries up to **5 times** on failure and verifies
  against the package's static manifest.

### Fixed

- **Installed version always `null`** — Foundry's `checkPackage` only returns
  the *remote* manifest, so updates believed everything was up to date. The
  installed version is now read from the package's static manifest.
- **`toggle_pause` reported success blindly** — the `pause` event carries no ack,
  so a refusal (insufficient rights) still looked like success. It now waits for
  the bot's role first and fails loudly on a non-GM account. (Foundry rebroadcasts
  `pause` to everyone *except* the sender, so waiting for a confirmation is a
  false negative — verified.) Found by testing a restricted-role bot.
- **`manage_modules` was annotated read-only** although it writes
  `core.moduleConfiguration` — clients could auto-approve it.

## [0.x] — 2026-07-16 → 2026-07-17 (pre-release)

- Independent **Rust rewrite**: single binary = native Foundry socket client +
  streamable-HTTP MCP transport, replacing the TypeScript connector (100 %
  parity validated by a 45/45 battery against a live v13 world).
- 126 tools: generic document CRUD, GM session tooling, game-system modules
  (Star Wars FFG with sheet derivation, D&D 5e, Daggerheart), Campaign Codex
  family, perception / interaction / atmosphere via the companion module, world
  administration.
- Foundry v13 & v14 (session binding auto-detected), route prefixes, per-collection
  reads with query pushdown and DB-index listings, infinite reconnection.
